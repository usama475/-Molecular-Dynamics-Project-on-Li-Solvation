Radial Distribution Function (RDF) plot → This shows how water oxygen atoms are distributed around the Li⁺ ion (the solvation structure). Peaks in the RDF correspond to solvation shells.  Mean Square Displacement (MSD) plot → This shows the motion of Li⁺ over time, from which you can estimate diffusivity.
